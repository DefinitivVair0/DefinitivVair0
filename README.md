Hi there, I am DefinitivVair0.

I upload small (and most of the time useless) projects I created. They are mostly just ideas and proof of concepts.

I know C#, Java and Delphi (and Scratch ;D). But lets be honest, no one cares about Delphi. 
I might not be particularly good at any of them so please feel free to give your input and feedback on my projects.

Some of my other interest include ITSec and Penetration Testing :D
